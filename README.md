# Supervised-ML
Supervised ML is a sub-category of ML. It is defined by its use of labeled dataset to train algorithms to classify data or predict outcomes accuractely. It uses training set to yield the desired output. Supervised ML can be divided into two types of problems - Classification and Regression.


Classification uses an algorithm which helps in dividing the dataset into classes based on different parameters. In Classification, a program is trained on the training dataset and based on that training, it categorizes the data into different classes. Common classification algorithms are Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, K Nearest Neighbor, Supoort Vector Machine etc.


Regression is the process of finding relation between dependent and independent variables. It is used to make predictions of values which are of continuous nature. Common regression algorithms are Simple Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Support Vector Regression etc.
